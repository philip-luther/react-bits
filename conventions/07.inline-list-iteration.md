# In-line list iteration

Where possible, iterate over lists of data in-line in the returned JSX unless
its internal logic is sufficiently complex enough to warrant moving outside of
the return statement and populating an array for rendering.

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.props.list.map(function (data, i) {
      return (<Component data={data} key={i}/>)
    })}
  </div>
);
```
