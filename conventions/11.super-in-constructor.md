Q: Is it necessary to call super() inside constructor?
A: Always call super() if you have a constructor and don't worry about it if you don't have a constructor.


Calling super() is necessary only if you need to have a constructor. Take a look at this code:
```javascript
class MyClass extends React.component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello { this.props.world }</div>;
  }
}
```
You don't have to call super() for every react component you create. However, if there is a constructor in your code, then you MUST call super:
```javascript
class MyClass extends React.component {
  constructor() {
    console.log(this); //Error: 'this' is not allowed before super()
    // The reason why this cannot be allowed before super() is because this is uninitialized if super() is not called.
  }
}
```
/You may think you can get away with an empty constructor without calling super():
* ES6 class constructors MUST call super if they are subclasses.
* Thus, you have to call super() as long as you have a constructor. (But a subclass does not have to have a constructor)
```javascript
class MyClass extends React.component {
  constructor() {
  } // Error: missing super() call in constructor
}
```
Q: What is the difference between calling super() and super(props)?
A: Call super(props) only if you want to access this.props inside the constructor. React automatically set it for you if you want to access it anywhere else.

The effect of passing props when calling super() allows you to access this.props in the constructor:
```javascript
class MyClass extends React.component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    console.log(this.props); // this.props is undefined
  }
}

//To fix it:
class MyClass extends React.component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props); // prints out whatever is inside props
  }
}

// There is no need to pass props into the constructor if you want to use it
// in other places. Because React automatically set it for you
class MyClass extends React.component {
  render() {
    // There is no need to call `super(props)` or even having a constructor
    // this.props is automatically set for you by React
    // not just in render but another where else other than the constructor
    console.log(this.props);  // it works!

  }
}
```
